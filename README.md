# Investigate-Stroop-Data
Investigate a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the Stroop Effect. 
In this project, we will investigate a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the Stroop Effect. We will then look at some data collected from others who have performed the same task and will compute some statistics describing the results. Finally, we will interpret our results in terms of our hypotheses.
